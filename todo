    i can render the informaticsheadViewReport page by checking of the 
    position of the logged in user is informaticshead but this foces me
    to have only the following user namings....
            <> informaticshead 
            <> admin, netcrawler [these are the admins]
            <> ithead, ishead, cshead
            <> maybe i will have normal users
